# 🎰 Lottery Game

Hey there! This is my **Lottery Game** – a simple, fun slot machine built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The idea came from wanting to make a small interactive game where you try your luck and have some fun with animations. You start with 3 lives, spin the slots, and if you match all three symbols, you win a prize – and yes, there’s confetti! 🎉

---

## 🛠 Features

- You start with **3 lives**, and lose one if you don’t get a match.
- Spin **three slots** with cute symbols like 🍒, 💎, 🍀, 🍋, ⭐.
- **Confetti animation** when you win – because winning should feel awesome!
- Game over message when you run out of lives.
- **Restart button** to play again after winning or losing.
- Clean and responsive UI thanks to **Tailwind CSS**.

## ⚙️ Tech I Used

- **React.js** (with functional components and hooks)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **react-icons** for hearts and fun symbols
- **react-confetti** for the win celebration
- **react-use** (just to get the screen size for confetti)
